# SPACE INVADERS MARK ZERO

## A CODE INSTITUTE STUDENT PROJECT
## Project #2 - User-Centric Frontend Development

Click "Start Game!" to start a new game. Use the up (or 'W') and down (or 'S') arrows on your keyboard to move your spaceship up and down on the screen. Avoid geting hit by any of the asteroids coming in from the right (As for now a asteroid hitting your ship will just stop in front of it).

<strong>Please Note!</strong> There has been some issues with the game running with ad-blockers activated. If the game do not start, try disable ad-blocker software.

This is the second of four individual projects we are to make during the 3 months Full Stack Developer course at Code Institute. Beside HTML5 and CSS3 this project is restricted to use of Javascript.

Since this stage of the course is mostly about Javascript, my idea is to make a small game using the HTML5 canvas element. This approach assures that most focus falls on Javascript. I am not using anything else than ”Vanilla” javascript and JQuery (and of course HTML and css with Bootstrap framework)

## THE GAME
The game I intend to build is my own interpretation of the very classical game ”Space Invaders” (Created by Tomohiro Nishikado 1978). By making yet another version of this game there is nothing new. My interpretation just happens to be;

### "THE SPACE INVADERS MARK-ZERO"
- “M A R K” - Because regardless of what this project becomes it will still be some kind of mark in the history of Space Invaders clones (Think like “Just another poor made broken bronze ax found in an archeological dig site still has its pretty small Mark in the history of bronze axes”).
- “Z E R O” - Because at the moment this proje#ct's mark is pretty much anything about Zero.


### GAME CONTENT - WHAT IS IT ABOUT?
The game is about a small spaceship fighting obstacles in a complete 2d environment. While the classical ”Space Invader” had a bottom/up perspective, my version goes from the left side of the screen where the player spaceship can move up and down (on the vertical axis). From the right side of the screen obstacles and enemies are appearing and move towards the player. These obstacles appear in various random positions, directions, speed, size and appearance. The player has to avoid being struck by these enemy objects, or the game is over. Possibly, the player can shoot at these enemies to make them disappear and maybe the enemies can shoot back at the player.
